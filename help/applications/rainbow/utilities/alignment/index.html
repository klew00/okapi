<h1 class="util1">Utility<font face="Arial"> – </font>ID-Based Alignment</h1>
<h2 class="util2">Overview</h2>
<p>This utility allows you to align the source and target content of documents 
based on the identifiers of the text units. In addition, each text unit can be 
segmented and this utility provides a basic default alignment of the segments, 
along with a visual editor to fix any issue within those segments.</p>
<p>Warning:<br>
This utility should be used only with documents formats that provide identifiers 
(e.g. Properties files). Text units without identifier will not be aligned.</p>
<p>Note:<br>
The result of the alignment is generated in a single TMX document even when the 
input is made of several input documents.</p>
<h2>Common Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The list of the source documents to align.</li>
	<li>The list of the corresponding target documents.</li>
	<li>The source language and default input encoding.</li>
	<li>The target language and default input encoding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Options Tab</h3>
<p>-- <cite>Full path of the TMX document to generate </cite>(Configuration key 
= <code>tmxPath</code>)</p>
<p>Enter the full path of the TMX document where to put the results of the 
alignment. If the document already exists it will be overwritten.</p>
<p>-- Create a translation memory with the following path (Configuration key =
<code>createTM</code>)</p>
<p>Set this option to create a translation memory from the results of the 
alignment. Enter the full path of the translation memory to create. If the 
translation memory already exists it will be overwritten.</p>
<p>-- <cite>Generate Trados workarounds</cite> (Configuration key = <code>useTradosWorkarounds</code>)</p>
<p>Set this option to generate Trados-specific output in the TMX document. This non-standard notation is needed 
to prevent loosing some characters such a the backslash or the curly braces when 
importing the TMX document in some versions of Trados Workbench.</p>
<p>TMX documents generated with this option are not standard TMX files and will 
likely not be imported correctly in tools correctly supporting TMX.</p>
<p>-- <cite>Segment the extracted text using the following SRX rules</cite> 
(Configuration key = <code>segment</code>)</p>
<p>Set this option to segment the content of each extracted text unit. If this 
option is set, the alignment is done first at the level of the text units (using 
their identifiers), then within each text unit, at the level of the segments. If 
this option is not set the alignment is done at the level of the text unit only.</p>
<p>-- <cite>SRX file for the source</cite> (Configuration key = <code>sourceSrxPath</code>)</p>
<p>Enter the path or URL of the SRX 
document where to take the SRX rules for the source language.</p>
<p>-- <cite>SRX file for the target</cite> (Configuration key = <code>targetSrxPath</code>)</p>
<p>Enter the path or URL of the SRX 
document where to take the SRX rules for the target language. Note that when the same document for both languages (most of the cases), the 
document is read only once, saving processing time.</p>
<p>-- <cite>Verify in-line codes for text units with single segment</cite> 
(Configuration key = <code>checkSingleSegUnit</code>)</p>
<p>Set this option to check the in-line codes of the text units that have only a 
single segment. If this option is set the utility checks for possible issues and 
may prompt the user to validate the alignment. If this option is not set the 
utility assumes aligned text units with a single segment do not need manual 
validation.</p>
<p>-- <cite>Use auto-correction automatically</cite> (Configuration key = <code>
useAutoCorrection</code>)</p>
<p>Set this option to automatically try to correct text units that have a 
different number of source and target segments. The user is always prompted to 
confirm the modifications made by auto-correction.</p>
