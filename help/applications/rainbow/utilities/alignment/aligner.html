<h1 class="dlgmain1">Utility – ID-Based Alignment</h1>
<h2 class="dlgmain2">Alignment Verification</h2>
<p>This dialog box allows you to verify and correct the automated alignment 
generated by the <a href="index.html">
ID-Based Alignment</a> utility.</p>
<h4>Indicators</h4>
<p>Name of the current source document used for this alignment.</p>
<p>Progress indicator: Source text unit you are currently seeing and how many 
text units there are in this target document. For example: <code>Source #59 / 
Targets: 2132</code> means that you are aligning the 59th text unit of the 
source, and that there are 2132 total text units in the target.</p>
<p>Identifier (name) of the current text unit.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Segments Lists</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The list of the source segments for the current text unit is shown 
on the left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The list of the target segments for the current text unit is shown 
on the right.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Options and Actions</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Synchronize scrolling</cite> -- Set this option to make 
synchronize the source and target segments list. When this option is set, 
selecting a segment in either the source or the target list will move the 
selection to the corresponding segment in the other list (if there is a 
corresponding segment).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Display in-line codes with generic markers</cite> -- Set this 
option to shown the in-line code as generic numbered place-holders instead of 
their real content. For example if you have a segment &quot;<code>Page [PgNum]</code>&quot; 
and &quot;<code>[PgNum]</code>&quot; is an in-line code, with this option set it will be 
shown as &quot;<code>Page &lt;1/&gt;</code>&quot;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Verify in-line codes for text unit with a single segment</cite> 
-- Set this option to run the in-line code checker even on text units that have 
a single segment. In such segments any in-line code differences between source 
and target is not due to incorrect segmentation since both text units are seen 
as a single segment. So the difference are likely to be normal and may not be 
worth verifying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Try an auto-correction automatically</cite> -- Set this 
option to automatically try to auto-correct segmentation when starting to edit 
the current text unit. This is the equivalent of clicking the <cite>Try Auto-Fix</cite> 
button immediately after the dialog box opens with a segmented text where 
incorrect segmentation has been detected. You are likely to want this option set 
all the time.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Edit Rules</cite> -- Click this button to open the
<a href="../../../../lib/ui/segmentation/index.html">Segmentation Rules Editor</a> 
for the current set of rules used. Note that any changes you make in the rules
<b>is not reflected</b> on the current alignment process. They will take effect 
next time after you are done with the current process.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Edit Segment</cite> -- Click this button to edit the content 
of the current target segment. You must preserve the in-line codes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Try Auto-Fix</cite> -- Click this button to try to 
automatically merge some segments that may be incorrectly split. The changes are 
based on the presence of anchor points in different segments. If the option
<cite>Try an auto-correction automatically</cite> is set you do not have to use 
this button as the auto-correction is run each time you make a modification.</p>
