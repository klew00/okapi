<h1 class="util1">Utility – Translation Comparison</h1>
<h2 class="util2">Overview</h2>
<p>This utility allows you to compare two sets of translated text.</p>
<p>The input is two document, the first one with the base translation, the 
second one with the translation to compare to the base translation. The two 
documents <b>must have the same number of entries</b> and the <b>entries must be in the same 
order</b>.</p>
<p>For each entry the utility compare the two translated text and calculate a 
score that indicates how similar the text of the second document is from the 
text of the first translation. the score is a number between 0 and 100. The 
score is based on the <i>Levenstein distance</i> and additional processing. You 
can find more information on that mertic at
<a href="http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm">http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm</a> 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance</a>.</p>
<p>The utility outputs an HTML document for each pair of input document. That 
file lists the pairs of text and the resulting score. You can also generate a 
TMX document with the pairs and their scores.</p>
<h2>Input Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The list of the documents containing the base translation (Input list 1)</li>
	<li>The list of the corresponding documents.containing the translation to 
	compare to the base one (Input list 2)</li>
	<li>The source language and default input encoding.</li>
	<li>The target language and default input encoding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Output Tab</h3>
<h4>HTML Output</h4>
<p><cite>Generate output tables in HTML</cite> -- Set this option to create one 
HTML file for each pair of input document, where the results of the comparisons 
are listed. The name of the HTML result file is the name of the document to 
compare with the base document, plus a <code>.html</code> extension, (Configuration key = <code>generateHTML</code>).</p>
<p><cite>Open the first HTML output after completion</cite> -- Set this option 
to open the first HTML result file created when the process is completed. 
(Configuration key = <code>autoOpen</code>).</p>
<h4>TMX Output</h4>
<p><cite>Generate a TMX output document</cite> -- Set this option to create one 
single TMX document that contains all the translations compared and their 
scores, for all input documents. (Configuration key = <code>generateTMX</code>).</p>
<p>Enter the full path of the TMX document to generate. If one already exists it 
will be overwritten (you will be prompted). (Configuration key = <code>tmxPath</code>).</p>
<p><cite>Suffix for the second target language code</cite> -- Enter the suffix 
to append to the target language code for the second target entries. For 
example, enter -mt to indicate that the second target language is a 
machine-translation generated text. If you do not enter a suffix, the language 
code for both target entries will be the same and the TMX document will include 
only the last one. (Configuration key = <code>trgSuffix</code>).</p>
