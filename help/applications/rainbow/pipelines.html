<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>A pipeline is a customizable set of steps that take the input documents 
provided in the input lists of Rainbow and execute each step in sequential 
order.</p>
<p>A step is a small unit of execution. It take a specific input (e.g a raw 
document), perform a specific 
task (e.g. parse the document extract text units out of it) on it and send a specific output 
(e.g. filter events) to the next step in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The steps communiicate through their input and output. There are two main 
types of input and output:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Raw document, which is simply a file.</li>
	<li>Filter events, which are the content of a raw document broken down into 
	standardized parts that include text units, start and end group, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any step that takes a raw document as input can be placed at the top of the 
pipeline or after any step that output a raw document. Any stsp that takes 
filter evenst as input needs to be placed after a step that output filter 
events.</p>
<p>The step <b>Raw document to Filter Events</b> provides a way to get a filter 
events output from a raw document input. And the step <b>Filter Events to Raw 
Document</b> provides a way to create a raw document from an input of filter 
events.</p>
<h2><a name="BasicDocDriven"></a>Basic Raw Document-Base Pipeline</h2>
<p>Some steps act directly on the raw document and output a raw document, for example when they perform tasks on the fille as a whole 
rather than its translatable text.</p>
<p>For example, the step <b>Encoding Conversion</b> reads a text file (without 
any filter) in a given encoding, and re-writes it in a different one. This step 
can be used in a one-step pipeline:</p>
<ol>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Encoding Conversion</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="BasicFilterDriven"></a>Basic Filter-Driven Pipeline</h2>
<p>Many steps work on text units and therefore require, at the least, an 
extraction step first.</p>
<p>For example, the step named <b>Full-Width Conversion</b>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Its input is a set of filter events.</li>
	<li>Its taks is to convert the content of the extracted text that is send 
	through text unit events in either full-width Japanese character, or 
	half-width ASCII/ depending on what option is selected.</li>
	<li>Its output is the same filter events it recieved, with the modified text 
	in the case of the text unit events.</li>
</ul>
<p>This step is not design to work alone: it needs to be fed filter events, and 
the text it modifies needs to be written out somewhere.</p>
<p>To fed a step with filter events you simply need a step just before that 
output filter events. This could be the <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> step 
which takes a normal file and creates the extracted data using the filters.</p>
<p>To re-write the filter events modified by the step you simply need one of the 
step that takes filter events as input and produce a raw document as output. 
This could be the <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> step which takes the filter 
events and create an output file in the original file format.</p>
<p>So your useable pipeline to convert the content of any input file that can be 
filtered will be made of three steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Full-Width Conversion</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> == raw document</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case we use the <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> step to create 
the output in the same format as the input, but you could use other steps to 
generate different outputs. For instance, the step <b>Format Conversion</b> 
allows you to choose between different bilingual formats (such as TMX, PO, etc.) 
for the output.</p>
<p>Some steps, such as <b>Search And Replace</b>, can take either a raw document 
or filter events as input and output either as well, depending on the step&#39;s 
options.</p>
<h2><a name="MultiTasks"></a>Multi-Tasks Pipelines</h2>
<p>The real power of pipelines really comes to light when you chain multiple 
steps without having to re-extract the text, or perform different raw-document 
taks one after the other automatically.</p>
<h2><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q: How do I specify what filter configuration to use with the <b>Raw Document to 
Filter Events</b> step?<br>
A: In the Rainbow Input List tabs, you associate one filter configuration per 
input file.</p>
<p>Q: How do I specify the name of the output file?<br>
A: In the Rainbow&#39;s Output tab, you can define the names and locations of all 
the input files based on their input file paths.</p>
<p>Q: How many steps can I chain together?<br>
A: There is no specific limit to the number of steps in a pipeline, only the 
available memory will limit what you can do (and pipelines do not take up a lof 
of memory).</p>
