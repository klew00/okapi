<h2><a name="Languages"></a>Languages</h2>
<p>The documents a filter processes can be monolingual or multilingual. The 
filter is responsible for knowing if it processes a monolingual or a 
multilingual document.</p>
<h3>Monolingual Documents</h3>
<p>Monolingual documents have their content in a single main language. In such 
document any target data replaces the source data. Examples of monolingual 
documents are Java properties file and OpenDocument files. Note that such 
documents may contain text in different languages (like a citation), but their 
structure is designed to have a single main language.</p>
<h4>Input</h4>
<p>Before sending the <code>START</code> event:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The filter must set the source language with the <code>
	IFilter.setOptions()</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>When sending the <code>START_DOCUMENT</code> event:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The filter must indicate the source language in the <code>StartDocument</code> 
	resource using <code>StartResource.StartDocument.setLanguage()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At any time when sending an event:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The filter should try to capture any information where the source 
	language is defined and create a modifiable property for it. This will allow 
	the writer to update the language settings of the output to the target 
	language. The filter should create read-only properties for language 
	information that are not source language.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3>Multilingual Documents</h3>
<h4>Input</h4>
<p>Multilingual documents have their content in several languages. They have a 
structure that is designed to hold the same content in different languages. The 
actual input document may contain only the source language content, but any 
target data will be placed along with the source data. In such documents the 
source data is not overwritten by the target data (except if the target language 
is the same as the source one). Examples of multilingual documents are PO files 
and XLIFF files.</p>
<p>Before sending the <code>START</code> event:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The filter must set the source and the target languages with the <code>
	IFilter.setOptions()</code> method. Note that the target language can be the 
	same as the source if the intent is to work on the source.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the filter sends the <code>START_DOCUMENT</code> event:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The filter must indicate that the document is multilingual in the <code>
	StartDocument</code> resource using <code>StartDocument.setIsMultilingual()</code>.</li>
	<li>The filter must indicate the source language in the <code>StartDocument</code> 
	resource using <code>StartResource.StartDocument.setLanguage()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At any time when sending an event:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The filter should try to capture any information where the source 
	language is defined and create a modifiable property for it. This will allow 
	the writer to update the language settings of the output to the target 
	language. The filter should create read-only properties for language 
	information that are not source language.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2><a name="Encodings"></a>Encodings</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The filter is responsible for detecting the encoding of the input document 
when possible. If the encoding cannot be detected, the filter should use the 
default encoding provided by the caller through the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/IFilter.html#setOptions(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, boolean)">IFilter.setOptions()</a></code> 
method.</p>
<p>If the input of the filter is a <code>CharSequence</code> (<code>as in
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/IFilter.html#open(java.lang.CharSequence)">
IFilter.open()</a></code>), the input encoding must be UTF-16.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the input encoding is UTF-8. The filter must handle the possible 
presence of a Byte-Order-Mark, and if it exists, not include it in the content 
of the document.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When sending the <code>START_DOCUMENT</code> event:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">The filter must 
set the encoding used for the input in the <code>StartDocument</code> resource. 
If the encoding is UTF-8, the filter must also indicate whether the original 
document has a BOM or not. If the encoding is not UTF-8 that indicator must be 
set to false (including for other UTF encodings). Both parameters are set using the
	<code>
	<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/resource/StartDocument.html#setEncoding(java.lang.String, boolean)">StartDocument.setEncoding()</a></code> method.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The encoding of an output generate by a writer (<code><a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/IFilterWriter.html">IFilterWriter</a></code> object) is 
not necessarily the same as the input encoding. The encoding to use is set by 
the caller through the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/IFilterWriter.html#setOptions(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)">IFilterWriter.setOption()</a></code> method. If the output encoding specified by that method is null, the 
filter should use the same encoding as the input document.</p>
<p>The writer should create the output document when 
receiving the <code>START_DOCUMENT</code> event. The <code>StartDocument</code> 
resource contains information such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The encoding of the input document.</li>
	<li>A flag set to true if the input encoding was UTF-8 and was using a 
	Byte-Order-Mark, set to false in all other cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="LineBreaks"></a>Line-Breaks</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The filter is responsible for detecting the type of line-break of the input 
document when possible. If the type of line-break cannot be detected (for 
example the input document has no line-breaks), the filter should assume the 
type of line-break to use is the one of the current platform.</p>
<ul>
	<li>All line-breaks passed in resources objects, for example the content of 
	a <code>TextUnit</code> object, must be standardized to a single line-feed 
	character (&quot;\n&quot;).</li>
	<li>All line-breaks inside skeleton objects must be in the same type as the 
	input (i.e. remain unchanged).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The writer must not change the type of line-break of a document. The original 
type of line-break is available in the <code>StartDocument</code> resource (<code>StartDocument.getLineBreak()</code>).</p>
<p>The reason for always using the original line-breaks in the output when using 
the filters is that the writer cannot change the line-breaks in the skeleton 
parts, so if different types of line-breaks are used in the skeleton and in the 
extracted content the output would end up with a mix of line-break types.</p>
<h2><a name="InlineCodes"></a>Inline Codes</h2>
<p>Inline codes are sections of the extracted text content that are not text, 
but codes. For example in the HTML content &quot;<code>Text in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;.</code>&quot; 
the two tags &quot;<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>&lt;/b&gt;</code>&quot; are inline codes.</p>
<p>Imagine a string from a Java properties file:</p>
<pre>&lt;b&gt;New file: {0}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;size={1}</pre>
<p>This string is composed of three types of data:</p>
<pre><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">&lt;b&gt;</span><span style="background-color: #00FF00">New file: </span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">{0}</span><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br/&gt;</span><span style="background-color: #00FF00">size=</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">{1}</span></pre>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;<code><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">&lt;b&gt;</span></code>&quot;, &quot;<span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><code>&lt;/b&gt;</code></span>&quot;, 
	and &quot;<code><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">&lt;br/&gt;</span></code>&quot; are 
	codes of the original format (HTML in properties)</li>
	<li>&quot;<code><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">{0}</span></code>&quot; and &quot;<code><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">{1}</span></code>&quot; 
	are variable place-holders, as such they are part of the text, but have one 
	aspect attached to them different from the other normal text: they should 
	not be deleted during translation or the string will loose its integrity.</li>
	<li>&quot;<code><span style="background-color: #00FF00">New file: </span></code>&quot; 
	and &quot;<code><span style="background-color: #00FF00">size=</span></code>&quot; are 
	simple spans of text.</li>
</ul>
<p>When extracted into a TextFragment each type of data needs to be preserved. 
The two first will be marked up with inline codes, while the simple text will be 
stored as simple text.</p>
<pre>{xE101}{xE110}New file: {0}{xE102}{xE111}{xE103}{xE112}, size={1}</pre>
<p>Codes are stored as a pair of special Unicode characters (each character is 
represented as <code>{xHHHH}</code> in these examples). The first character of 
the pair is always a Unicode character U+E101, U+E102, or U+E103. They 
respectively indicate an opening code, a closing code, and a standalone code.</p>
<p>Note: The character U+E104 is also used in some special strings to denote a 
segment placeholder, but for the most part all the segmentation mechanism is 
internal and you should not have to deal with segment placeholders.</p>
<p>The second special character of the pair is the index that points to the 
location of the code's data in the codes array that goes along with the coded 
string. To avoid collision between index values (that should be 0 and above) and 
real characters, the index character is the real index value + 0xE110. This make 
the resulting character fall into the Private Use Area of Unicode, safe away for 
normal characters.</p>
<p>Along with the string, the <code>TextFragment</code> holds a list of Code objects. each 
entry of that list corresponds to one of the code. The correspondence between 
the index of the code in the list and the code marker in the string is computed 
using the second character of the code marker: character value - 0xE110 gives 
the index value in the list.</p>
<pre><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">{xE101}{xE110}</span>New file: {0}<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">{xE102}{xE111}{xE103}{xE112}</span>, size={1}

 |      |                   |      +-- 0xE111-0xE110 = 1
 |      |                   +-- 0xE102 = CLOSING
 |      |
 |      +-- 0xE110-0xE110 = 0
 +-- 0xE101 = OPENING</pre>
<p>codes[0]={tagType=OPENING, id=0, type=&quot;bold&quot; data=&quot;&lt;b&gt;&quot;, 
flag=CLONEABLE|DELETABLE}<br>
codes[1]={tagType=CLOSING, id=0, type=&quot;bold&quot; data=&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, 
flag=CLONEABLE|DELETABLE}<br>
codes[2]={tagType=PLACEHOLDER, id=1, type=&quot;lb&quot; data=&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;, 
flag=CLONEABLE|DELETABLE}</p>
<p>The TextFragment class offers methods to manipulate the text and codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are often parts of the content that need to have specific properties 
assigned to them. In our example, &quot;<code>{0}</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>{1}</code>&quot; 
should not be modified and should not be removed.</p>
<p>You can do this using the inline annotation mechanism.</p>
<p>An inline annotation is composed of a type and the annotation itself. You can 
use the append() method to append a code with an annotation when constructing a 
coded text. Or you can use the annotate() method to apply an annotation to a 
selection of a coded text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Original codes - Codes that hold a chunk of data of the original format that 
is not part of the text and denote some kind or formatting or function. Such 
codes can work as a pair )(when they mark a start and its corresponding end), or 
they can be standalone. For example, the tags <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/b&gt;</code> 
that indicate the start and the end of a span of bolded text in HTML, and the 
element <code>&lt;img src='abc.png'/&gt;</code> is an example of standalone code.</p>
<p>Annotations - Codes that simply mark the start and end of a span of text that 
has specific properties associated to it, which are not directly part of the 
original format. Such codes have no chunk of original data associated. For 
example, in a C++ string <code>&quot;File name: %s&quot;</code>, the text <code>&quot;%s&quot;</code> 
should never be deleted.</p>
<p>In a TextFragment object both are represented using inline codes.</p>
