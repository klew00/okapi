<h2>Overview</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Okapi Framework is a set of interface specifications, object 
models, components and applications that provides an environment to build 
interoperable tools for localizing and translating documentation and software.</p>
<p>The goal of the Okapi Framework is to allow tools developers and 
localizers to build new localization processes or enhance existing ones to best 
meet their needs, while preserving compatibility and 
interoperability. It also provides them with a way to share (and re-use) 
components across different solutions. The project uses and promotes open 
standards, when they exist.</p>
<p>[Okapi is pronounced <i>o-ka-py</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?okapi001.wav=okapi">hear 
it</a>)]</p>

<p class="smallnote">Note: This web site is dedicated to the <b>Java implementation</b> of the Okapi 
Framework. There is an older .NET implementation as well. It is still maintained 
but any new development is now done in the Java branch. The Web site for <a href="http://okapi.sourceforge.net">
Okapi NET is hosted on SourceForge</a> and is still available.</p>
<h2>Using the Framework</h2>
<p>Here are some of the concrete example of things build with the Okapi 
Framework:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="help/applications/rainbow/index.html">Rainbow</a></b> - A ready-to-use graphical user interface to launch Okapi-compliant 
	utilities. Utilizing Rainbow allows the users to have a simple and common 
	way to specify some of the options of all utilities. Rainbow can also be 
	used in command-line mode.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b><a href="help/applications/rainbow/utilities/extraction/index.html">Translation Package Creation</a></b> - A utility that makes use 
	of the various Okapi filters to extract translatable text from different 
	file formats and generate translation kits in different formats such as 
	<a href="standards.html#xliff">XLIFF</a> or RTF that can be used with different translation tools such as Wordfast or Trados Translators Workbench. It can also create more specific 
	packages some products such as OmegaT.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <b><a href="help/filters/ui/regex/index.html">Regex Filter</a></b> - A component that provides you a way to read 
	and write any text-based file and extract text parts using regular 
	expressions. It implements the programming interface common to the all the 
	Okapi filters. This simplify the development of programs or scripts to 
	perform any type of tasks on the translatable text of the files. Many other 
	formats are have also their own filter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="help/lib/ui/segmentation/index.html">Ratel</a></b> - A simple application to create and maintain 
	segmentation rules. Such rules are used to break down translatable text in 
	more meaningful parts. Ratel implements an SRX-based engine. 
	<a href="standards.html#srx">SRX is the 
	Segmentation Rules eXchange format</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond using existing tools and components you can also easily develop 
programs and scripts that use the framework's components to create customized 
solutions for your specific needs. <a href="developers.html">See the Developers 
Notes page</a> for more details on this.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>The Okapi Framework project is hosted on Google Code, a repository of open 
source software. You can bring you own contribution in many different ways. For example, by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">using the various Okapi components and applications on your 
	platforms and
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/issues/list">reporting bugs and 
	issues</a></li>
	<li>providing feedback, corrections and suggestions on the documentation and 
	the specifications</li>
	<li>creating new tutorials</li>
	<li>suggesting improvements to the existing material or recommending new 
	developments</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you have the appropriate skills for some of the current work 
being done, you can also participate directly in the development of Okapi 
libraries, components, and applications, or in developing help and 
documentation. For more information on this topic, please contact one of the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/">project's owners listed in the 
bottom-right corner of the Google Code main page</a>.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Open source software can exist only because of the resources provided by some 
people and companies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Several companies have dedicated some time of their developers 
	to working on developing the framework and have contributed portions of 
	source code. You can find them in the
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/">Google Code project's Web site</a>.</li>
	<li>
	<p>End-users (localization engineers, developers, translators, and 
	project managers), especially the one actively involved in the
	<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/okapitools/">Okapi Tools users 
	group</a> mailing list, supply valuable feedback, ideas, bug reports, and 
	other contributions to the project.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Brooks Kline did 
	the Okapi Framework logo.</li>
</ul>
