<h2>Changes from M8 to M9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Rainbow:<ul>
	<li>Translation package Post-Processing utility:<ul>
	<li>Fixed the bug where pre-translated XLIFF entries with translate=&#39;no&#39; 
	could not be merged back properly, for example for PO files.</li>

	<li><u><b>IMPORTANT</b></u>: Changed the H2 database dependency from version 
	1.1.103 (.data.db files) to 1.2.135 (.h2.db files), this breaks backward 
	compatibility: the new SimpleTM connector cannot open the old .data.db 
	files. To convert an older TM: Use a M8 or prior version of Rainbow to run 
	the <b>SimpleTM to TMX</b> step to export your database to TMX. Then, Use 
	this version of Rainbow to run the <b>Generate SimpleTM</b> step to convert

	<li>Added the XML Validation Step. It performs well-formness XML 
	verification and optionally, DTD or schema validation.</li>
	<li>Sentence Aligner Step:<ul>

</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Diff Leverage Step:<ul>
	<li>Added support for 3 input files: new source, old source, old

	text()</code>.</li>
	<li>The <code>net.sf.okapi.lib.extra.pipelinebuilder</code> package has been 
	added. It allows you to easily script run pipelines, for example using 
	Jython.</li>
