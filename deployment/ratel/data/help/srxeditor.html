<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>SRX (Segmentation Rules eXchange) is a standard format to store segmentation 
rules. You can find the specifications of SRX 2.0 here:
<a href="http://www.lisa.org/fileadmin/standards/srx20.html">
http://www.lisa.org/fileadmin/standards/srx20.html</a>.</p>
<p>Segmentation rules are used to indicate to translation and other 
linguistic-oriented tools how to split a text into small meaningful sequence of 
words (for example in sentences).</p>
<p>This editor can load SRX version 1.0 documents, but they will be saved as 
version 2.0 documents. You will be warned both when opeing and saving SRX 1.0 
documents. Be aware that versions 1.0 and 2.0 of SRX may be 
incompatible depending on how the version 1.0 document was interpreted by the 
tool that created the file.</p>
<h2><a name="mainWindow"></a>Main Window</h2>
<p>The main window is divided in two parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The upper part list all the rules for the group currently selected.</li>
	<li>The lower part is the example area where you can try out the rules and 
	see how they behave on a give text.</li>
</ul>
<p><cite>Language rules currently displayed</cite> -- Select the language group 
you want to work with. All the rules for the selected language group are display 
in the list below.</p>
<p><cite>Groups and Options</cite> -- Click this button to open the <cite>
<a href="#groupsAndOptions">Groups and Options</a></cite> dialog box where you 
can specify language groups and how they are mapped to languages.</p>
<p><cite>Add</cite> -- Click this button to add a new rule at the end of the 
current group.</p>
<p><cite>Edit</cite> -- Click this button to edit the rule currently selected.</p>
<p><cite>Remove</cite> -- Click this button to remove the rule currently 
selected from the current group.</p>
<p><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Click this button to move the rule currently selected 
upward in the group.</p>
<p><cite>Move down</cite> -- Click this button to move the rule currently 
selected downward in the group.</p>
<p><cite>Char Info</cite> -- Click this button to get information about the 
character currently selected in the <cite>Sample text</cite> edit box.</p>
<h2><a name="groupsAndOptions"></a>Groups and Options Dialog</h2>
<p>This dialog box allows you to create, edit and remove groups of rules and 
language maps.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p><cite>Segment sub-flow items</cite> -- Set this option to set the SRX <code>
segmentsubflows</code> attribute to <code>yes</code>. This option is used by 
some tool to know if they should segment text runs embedded inside other text 
runs.</p>
<p><cite>Cascade language maps matching</cite> -- Set this option to enable 
language map matches to cascade.</p>
<p><cite>Include opening in-line codes</cite> -- Set this option to include any 
opening in-line code located just before a break with the segment being 
closed. If this option is not set such in-line code should be placed in the next 
segment. For example, assuming a period follow by a space has a break after the 
period:</p>
<pre> ON: Sentence one.&lt;b&gt; Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt; ==&gt; [Sentence one.&lt;b&gt;][ Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt;]
OFF: Sentence one.&lt;b&gt; Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt; ==&gt; [Sentence one.][&lt;b&gt; Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt;]</pre>
<p><cite>Include closing in-line codes</cite> -- Set this option to include any 
closing in-line code located just before a break with the segment being 
closed. If this option is not set such in-line code should be placed in the next 
segment. For example, assuming a period follow by a space has a break after the 
period:</p>
<pre> ON: Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.&lt;/b&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.&lt;/b&gt;][ Sentence two.]
OFF: Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.&lt;/b&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.][&lt;/b&gt; Sentence two.]</pre>
<p><cite>Include isolated in-line codes</cite> -- Set this option to include any 
isolated code located just before a break with the segment being closed. 
If this option is not set such in-line code should be placed in the next 
segment. For example, assuming a period follow by a space has a break after the 
period:</p>
<pre> ON: Sentence one.&lt;br/&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence one.&lt;br/&gt;][ Sentence two.]
OFF: Sentence one.&lt;br/&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence one.][&lt;br/&gt; Sentence two.]</pre>
<h3>Language Rules</h3>
<p>List of all the groups of rules in the document.</p>
<p><cite>Add</cite> -- Click this button to add a group of rules to the list.</p>
<p><cite>Rename</cite> -- Click this button to rename the group of rules 
currently selected. Note that references to that group in the language maps are
<b>not</b> updated automatically.</p>
<p><cite>Remove</cite> -- Click this button to remove the group of rules 
currently selected. The program will ask for confirmation. Note that references 
to that group in the language maps are <b>not</b> updated automatically.</p>
<h3>Language Maps</h3>
<p>List of all the language maps in the document.</p>
<p><cite>Add</cite> -- Click this button to add a language map to the list.</p>
<p><cite>Edit</cite> -- Click this button to edit the language map currently 
selected.</p>
<p><cite>Remove</cite> -- Click this button to remove the language map currently 
selected.</p>
<p><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Click this button to move the language map currently 
selected upward in the list.</p>
<p><cite>Move Down</cite> -- Click this button to move the language map 
currently selected downward in the list.</p>
<h2><a name="dlgLanguageMap"></a>Edit Language Map Dialog</h2>
<p>This dialog box allows you to edit the data of a language map.</p>
<p><cite>Regular expression describing the language map</cite> -- Enter the 
regular expression matching the language or languages for the language rule 
(group of rules) of this language map.</p>
<p><cite>Name of the language rule associated with the regular expression</cite> 
-- Enter the name of the language rule (group of rules) for this language map. 
The name is case-sensitive.</p>
<h2><a name="dlgRule"></a>Edit Rule Dialog</h2>
<p>This dialog box allows you to edit the data of a rule.</p>
<p><cite>Expression before the position</cite> -- Enter the regular expression 
for the text just before the break point of this rule.</p>
<p><cite>Expression after the position</cite> -- Enter the regular expression

tags (e.g. <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;/tag&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;tag/&gt;</code>) to simulate in-line codes. 
The entire content of the file is considered as a single text unit (i.e. line 
breaks are not seen as any specific type of paragraph delimiters).</p>
<p><cite>Full path of the output file</cite> -- enter the full path of the 
resulting document.</p>
<p><cite>Create HTML output</cite> -- Set this option to generate the 
segmentation results in the form of an HTML table, with each segment in a row.

characters '<code>[</code>' and '<code>]</code>' denoting the segments.</p>
<h2><a name="fileMenu"></a>File Menu</h2>
