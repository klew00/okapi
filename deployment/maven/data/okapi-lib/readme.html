<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The <b>okapi-lib</b> distribution is a collection of Java classes design to help in 
programming components and applications related to translation and localization 
tasks. It offers a low-level resource model, as well as a set of common API to 
extract text parts from their original format, modify them, and merge them back. 
The library also provides facilities to manipulate, annotated and in general, 
work with the extracted text.</p>
<p>The distribution comes also with 
<a href="http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=Tikal">
<b>Tikal</b>, a command-line tool</a> to execute some simple 
localization-related tasks, like extraction and merge of 
<a href="http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=XLIFF">XLIFF documents</a>. If 
you want to use others Okapi tools (e.g. Rainbow),
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/downloads/list">download one of the 
platform-specific <b>okapi-apps</b> distributions</a>.</p>
<p>For a list of changes since the previous release, 
please see the <a href="changes.html">Changes Log document</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note that parts of this project are still relatively new and still in development. Some of 
the classes, interfaces and internal workings presented here may change in the 
upcoming versions of the Okapi Framework.</b></p>
<p>This distribution contains the following:</p>

	which are available on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) for 64-bit machines, and on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow 
	Leopard) for 64-bit and 32-bit machines. On Mac OX 10.7 (Lion) there is no

	<li>Extract the file on any location. Make sure to preserve the full paths 
	when extracting.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Uninstallation</h3>

<h2><a name="JARDependencies"></a>JAR Dependencies</h2>
<p>Several Okapi packages depend on thir-party libraries. While the Okapi 
packages are distributed in a single JAR file, it is easy to build separate JAR 
files if needed.</p>
<p>For more information on what third-party libraries are used with which 
package, see the <code>pom.xml</code> file of each package in the source code:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/source/browse/#svn/trunk">
http://code.google.com/p/okapi/source/browse/#svn/trunk</a></p>
<p>Currently most dependencies are for the connectors and for some filters and 
steps. The Okapi core package has no dependencies.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Support"></a>Support</h2>
<p>The <code>examples</code> directory contains source code of examples in Java that use the Okapi libraries.</p>
<p>If you have questions, suggestions or bug to report, you can do this 
different ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Read and post notes in the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/okapitools/">Okapi Tools users group</a> (you need to be registered member to post, but 
	not to read).</li>
	<li>Read an post issue report on the
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/issues/list">Google Code project 
	site</a>.</li>
</ul>
